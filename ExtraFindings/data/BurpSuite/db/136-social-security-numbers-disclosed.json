        "Applications sometimes disclose sensitive personal information such as social security numbers. Responses containing social security numbers may not represent any security vulnerability - for example, a number may belong to the logged-in user to whom it is displayed. If a social security number is identified during a security assessment it should be verified, then application logic reviewed to identify whether its disclosure within the application is necessary and appropriate."

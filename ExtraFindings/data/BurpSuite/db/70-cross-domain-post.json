        "Applications sometimes use POST requests to transfer sensitive information from one domain to another. This does not necessarily constitute a security vulnerability, but it creates a trust relationship between the two domains. Data transmitted between domains should be reviewed to determine whether the originating application should be trusting the receiving domain with this information."

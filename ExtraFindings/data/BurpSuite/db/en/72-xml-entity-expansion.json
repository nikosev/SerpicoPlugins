    "description": [
        "XML entity expansion vulnerabilities arise because the XML specification allows XML documents to define entities that reference other entities defined within the document. If this is done recursively to a significant depth, then the XML parser will consume exponentially increasing amounts of memory and processor resources as each level of recursion is processed. This might result in a denial-of-service condition, causing the entire application to stop functioning.",
        "Note: To avoid causing an actual denial-of-service, Burp Suite merely verifies that entities are being recursively expanded to a modest depth. It is possible that reported applications are not actually vulnerable because they are designed to prevent entity expansion beyond a given depth."
